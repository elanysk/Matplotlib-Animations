# Matplotlib-Animations
Fun little math-driven animations and simulations using matplotlib.

 - **gravity**
simulates forces of attraction between two sets of particles

 - **rectangles_in_nxn_grid**
Animation that shows that the number of different rectangles in a square of size nxn is equal to the sum of the cubes of the natural numbers n. For example, In a square of size 6 units x 6 units, there are 1^3 + 2^3 +3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 + 6^3 = 441 rectangles.
